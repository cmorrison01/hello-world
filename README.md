# hello-world

This is ME!

Hello All! I'm Carmen from the Pelican state of Louisiana. 
I have been working for the largest telecommunications company for 9 years and counting. 
I'm also a Computer Science graduate but am just getting back into programming after about 8 years. 
My focus will be Web Development and I'm excited about learning a lot of new things to further my career.
